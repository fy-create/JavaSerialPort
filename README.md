* Debugging any serial software or hardware.
* Development of serial peripheral hardware.
* Development of serial device drivers.
* Researching the functionality of any third-party software and hardware.
* Implementing, debugging or testing serial protocol between device and device driver.

SerialPort SDK can be used by:
* Software developers
* Hardware engineers
* Programmers
* Testers
* Science technicians
* Lab experts
* University students

This SDK includes the RXTX library.
